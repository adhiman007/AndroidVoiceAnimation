AndroidVoiceAnimation
=====================

A voice animation demo just like google voice search.  
Use the MediaRecorder to record audio, haven't test on most devices.  
Because I use the `ObjectAnimator` class, so the minApiLevel is 11.You can use the [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) library to make it backwards compatible.
